title: "Debunking Assumptions about Language in Information-Seeking"
event: FIMS Graduate Research Day

location: www.zoomlinkwillbehere.com

abstract: Monolingualism is often considered the "default" status in North America, and so too in LIS information-seeking scholarship. I present a few quick exemplars from my thesis-in-progress of highly-skilled Multilinguals' Everyday Information Seeking that complicate monolingual assumptions about language skills, information availability, and university pedagogy.
