title: "Where the money flows and revenue grows: analyzing open access article processing charges"

abstract: "This talk touches on a current research project that explores the amount of APCs paid by Tri-Agency grant holders when publishing OA. Researchers more often use large amounts of grant funds to pay for OA costs (APCs), which means public tax dollars are being streamed into the revenues of large commercial publishers. It is important to monitor and collect data on APC spend, especially as the APC market continues to grow, costs inflate, and business models change."
