abstract: In 2021, the CAPAL Research and Scholarship Committee launched a mentorship program to bring together early career researchers with seasoned scholars to support them through their research projects. The pilot program ran from July 2021 to April 2022, and the goal of this session is to go over the program, present our data and findings and discuss the future of the program. The sub-committee for this program presented a journey-mapping exercise at last year's CAPAL Conference and we are excited to report on the progress of the program.  We will identify potential benefits of a mentorship program focused on research and scholarship, and discuss the opportunities and challenges of a group mentorship model.
