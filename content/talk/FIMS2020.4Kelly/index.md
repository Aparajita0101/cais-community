title: "Dark Patterns of Account Deletion in Social Networking Sites"
event: FIMS Graduate Research Day
event_url: ../../event/uwo-workshop

location: www.zoomlinkwillbehere.com

abstract: "The presentation will focus on “dark patterns”: user interface design techniques that attempt to manipulate users into making choices that benefit online service providers. More specifically, I will describe the early work that I have completed for a study exploring how social networking sites (SNSs) utilize dark patterns to dissuade users from deleting their accounts. In addition to summarizing the literature review and discussing the data collection process, I will present a classification scheme that identifies and organizes the various account deletion dark patterns found within a sample of popular SNSs."
