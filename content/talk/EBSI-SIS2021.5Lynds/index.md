abstract: "Information literacy has never been more important for the functioning of the democratic process, and for autonomy over oneâ€™s decisions. The Association for College and Research Libraries (ACRL) created a framework for information literacy, which lists six threshold concepts that an information literate individual possesses. This paper seeks to identify where in the curriculum information literacy is promoted, and which information literacy integrated abilities are most commonly found. A systematic mapping of the information literacy threshold concepts in the course learning outcomes was conducted. Findings from this study will reveal strengths and weaknesses in IL competencies in the Nova Scotia high school courses. This study also provides recommendations for future research."
