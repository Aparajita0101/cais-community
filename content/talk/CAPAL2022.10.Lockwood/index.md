title: "Creating a digital mindfulness resource guide for students"

abstract: College can be a stressful experience for students due to high costs of education, food insecurity, time management, and individual health conditions. With the recent global pandemic, the University of Oregon (UO) has pivoted many of its in-person mental health services to remote operations that include teletherapy, remote workshops, and other online resources such as mobile apps to provide students access to health services. One of the goals of UO Libraries’ instruction program is to teach students to critically evaluate information they find in various locations and formats. Specific to this effort, UO Libraries supported a DREAM Lab student employee to review campus-supported apps, create a digital mindfulness app evaluation rubric to aid students in decision making about their data privacy and care, and ultimately to create an online guide for the UO community. The student’s process included talking to institutional partners and medical professionals, researching the associated risks of data privacy and security within mHealth apps, researching mHealth app evaluation methods, and carefully reading the data privacy standards of suggested apps. The guide creators are assessing the guide’s impact on the student community through an embedded survey, as well as usage statistics. Preliminary results will be shared at the CAPAL Conference.
