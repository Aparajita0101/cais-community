### Summary
Call for Proposals

The Canadian Association of Professional Academic Librarians (CAPAL) invites you to participate in its annual conference, to be held online June 6-7, 2022. This year the conference will be free to attend for both members and non-members. This conference offers librarians and allied professionals across all disciplines an alternative space to share research and scholarship, challenge current thinking about professional issues, and forge new relationships.

CAPAL22: Libraries and Wellness

How do we define wellness and what does it mean in the context of the academic library? Can wellness play a role in academic libraries? Moreover, should it?

This CAPAL22: Libraries and Wellness conference will contemplate if and how wellness might be integrated into academic librarianship and academic library services. Together, we’ll wonder how our spaces, classrooms, and collections can contribute to a healthy, scalable, and sustainable future for academic libraries and their communities; if and how our current conceptions of wellness are compatible with equity, diversity and inclusivity projects, and how we can build ways of working together that are generative and affirming.
