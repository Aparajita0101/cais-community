# user groups are useful if you want to have a "people" page where all users for certain groups are displayed. But these are for the whole site so we most likely won't use them for events. 
# Here I put the community platform moderators group because I think we should at least have that on the main page. Then maybe we could have a "contributor" group for those who write original content for the platform such as blog posts.
